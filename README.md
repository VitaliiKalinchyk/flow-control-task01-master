# The sum of odd digits

The purpose of this exercise is to train you to work with loop statements.

Estimated workload of this exercise is _30 min_.

### Description
Please, proceed to [`LoopStatements`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/LoopStatements.java) class
and implement its static method:
---
* `int task1(int n)`\
  For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum of the odd numbers of n.

###  Example:  
`n = 1234 `   -> result =  4   
`n = 246`  ->  result =  0  

---

### Examples

---
Code Sample:
```java
...
System.out.println(LoopStatements.task1(1234));
System.out.println(LoopStatements.task1(246));
```

Output:
```
4
0
```
